The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-element selectors. Instead, apply the styles directly in the HTML, or use a utility-first approach:

```html
<div class="relative">
  <span class="absolute top-0 content-['✨']"> </span>
</div>
```

This applies the styles directly to the pseudo-element `::before` or `::after` without relying on the `@apply` directive and thus resolves the issue.  Alternatively, create a custom CSS class:

```css
.my-pseudo-element::after {
  content: "✨";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}
```

Then you could use this in your HTML:

```html
<div class="my-pseudo-element"></div>
```
