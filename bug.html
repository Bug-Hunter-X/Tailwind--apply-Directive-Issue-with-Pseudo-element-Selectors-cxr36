This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a CSS rule that contains a pseudo-element selector (like `::before` or `::after`).  The `@apply` directive is not able to properly process and apply these rules, leading to the styles not being applied correctly. For example:

```html
<div class="@apply after:content-['âœ¨'] after:absolute after:top-0"></div>
```

This would not apply the `after` styles because `@apply` cannot handle pseudo-elements directly.
